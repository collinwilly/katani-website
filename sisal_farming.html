        <p>The sisal industry is the oldest commercially organised agricultural undertaking and one of the longest surviving
            agricultural industries in Tanzania. Introduced in 1893 by Dr. Richard Hindorf a German Agronomist, as a commercial
            crop, the sisal industry grew to become the most extensive commercial agriculture and primary processing in Central
            Africa, spreading to Kenya, Mozambique and Angola. Peak production was reached in 1964 when Tanzania alone produced
            234,000 tons grown in Tanga, Morogoro, Coast, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Singida, Iringa, Mwanza, Shinyanga, Mara,
            Mtwara and Lindi regions, virtually throughout Tanzania.</p>
        <p>
            Sisal has played a significant role in the country's economy being the largest foreign exchange earner in Tanzania up to
            the 70's and the largest employer providing employment to over 1,000,000 permanent and casual workers. It is
            expected to continue as it still provides a well being for a very large number of people in the country. This
            is due to the characteristics of the sisal plant itself. The importance of the crop for the country's economic
            growth, rural development and provision of employment opportunities, now and in future, cannot be taken lightly
            as the crop is drought resistant and very tolerant to a variety of soils, hence it can enable even arid areas
            to be brought into productivity that would not be possible for other crops. Sisal is the only crop where Tanzania
            was the largest producer in the world, producing the best quality.</p>
        <p>
            Presently, even in a depressed state, the sisal industry is employing over 100,000 people and is the fourth largest agricultural
            exporter. The predominant mode of production is still estate based even in the smallholder and out grower schemes
            that have been established.</p>
        <p>
            During the 1960s and 1970s there was serious development of secondary fibre processing factories producing sisal twines,
            yarns, ropes, bags, carpets, pulp and paper. Sisal was and is still also being used in the construction and manufacturing
            industry for padding, in mattresses and handcrafts (see sisal products). A good percentage of this capacity is
            still available but under utilised due to low fibre production and unfavorable policies in local production.
            Also, in efforts to add value to the raw sisal fibre as only the 2% of the sisal plant is utilised to produce
            fibre the remaining 98% biomass that is thrown away as "waste" at cost both financially and to the environment
            is now known to contain serious economic value and is being seriously exploited. (see
            <a href="mes.html">sisal energy</a>)</p>
        <p>
            Katani Ltd was formed during the transformation of the economy in Tanzania to a free market seeing new opportunities cropping
            up after years of product and market research. Since then the industry has started reviving itself as an emerging
            market and production had increased to 35,000 tons by 2010 showing an increasing upward trend in production by
            54% from 1997 which is continuing to gather momentum.</p>

        <p>Since before the privatisation of the Sisal industry under the former Tanzania Sisal Authority (TSA) there has been
            extensive research into sisal that has been carried on by Katani Ltd which has concluded significant attributes
            of the sisal plant. There are ten attractive characteristics of sisal that do not occur in any other industry
            in Tanzania namely;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The naturally safe and environmentally friendliness use of sisal for making products and more so as a renewable energy resource
                in rural and town areas.</li>
            <li>
                The extensive Market Research into new fibre-based products that has market potential running into millions of tons worldwide.
                This in addition to traditional products which are still extensively demanded. And as sisal can be grown
                and processed in every region of Tanzania, with serious investment, an increase in production even 40 times
                can be reached in 15 years.</li>
            <li>
                The 98% biomass, so called "waste" hitherto thrown away, is now known to be more valuable than the 2% if fully exploited.
                This opens up further market opportunities for sisal to produce energy, medicinal, composite and value added
                products such as pulp for paper, which will be very competitive.</li>

            <li>The toughness of the sisal plant. It thrives well in drought conditions or heavy rain. In more than 100 years
                of commercial production in Tanzania, there has not been a single drought that has killed sisal. Drought
                is the worst enemy of rain-fed agriculture, but sisal can be grown virtually in all regions of Tanzania.</li>

            <li>The ability of sisal to survive under harsh conditions in marginal land and even fire providing protection against
                soil erosion and it can be inter-cropped with food and cash crops like maize, cotton, legumes and sunflower.</li>
            <li>Planting or harvesting of sisal can be done at any time of the year. The mature plant can be left for more than
                12 months without affecting the plant or quality of harvest. Sisal fibre can be stored for over five years
                without affecting its quality. It has no post harvest losses.</li>

            <li>All established sisal estates have established infrastructures and civic facilities. They are natural farm centres,
                which can offer other services like banking, insurance, pension and telecommunications to the rural areas.</li>
            <li>The abundance of managerial, skilled and semi-skilled workers with qualifications and experience in the sisal
                industry built over a period of more than 100 years of commercial production.</li>
            <li>Tanzania boasts to have the only sisal Research Centre in the world at Mlingano, Tanga now equipped with an ultra-modern
                Meristematic.</li>
